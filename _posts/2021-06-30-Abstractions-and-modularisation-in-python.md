Hi guys, here I am gonna talk about abstractions in python and how they help make code modular. Abstractions and the ease of using it in my opinion has made python extremely popular, cause with its huge community base we have modular packages developed for almost everything in python. 

## Abstraction

So what is abstraction? Its essentially an art of abstracting or hiding the non essential details. In terms of programming, we may not need to know how a certain function or class works but we just want to and need to know how to use it and if it does the job for us. for eg -

## Modularisation

We followed the Micro Service Architecture for deployment. The micro service architecutre essentially entails that different aspects/features of the project can be worked on independently and deployed separately. In this manner the application is not a whole and hence in case of an issue the entire website dosent need to brought down. We can continue to work and upgrade independent features and incorporate them onto websites.

## A popular Hierarchy

functions>classes>modules>packages>APIs maybe?
