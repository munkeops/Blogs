This post is gonna give a gentle introduction to what is OpenVINO and how you can use it to increase vision based algorithms inference speeds. 



## Intel's OpenVino

Intel's OpenVINO is an inference framework that essentially optmises deeplearning, more specifically vision and video based processing on a series of supported intel hardware. The intro as per Intel's documentation is as below :

>OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and solutions that solve a variety of tasks including emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others. Based on latest generations of artificial neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent and attention-based networks, the toolkit extends computer vision and non-vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance. It accelerates applications with high-performance, AI and deep learning inference deployed from edge to cloud.

## Supported hardware

The OpenVINO framework only supports a subsection of all available intel hardwares.

## Steps to setup an API

functions>classes>modules>packages>APIs maybe?
