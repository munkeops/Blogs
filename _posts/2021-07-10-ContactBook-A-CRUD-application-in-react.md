Hey, so this post is gonna be about a simple CRUD application made in React directly connecting to a Mongo Instance. This post and project aims to help take the baby steps at developing such an application just like I did.

## ContactBook

So what is abstraction? Its essentially an art of abstracting or hiding the non essential details. In terms of programming, we may not need to know how a certain function or class works but we just want to and need to know how to use it and if it does the job for us. for eg -

## Tools

We followed the Micro Service Architecture for deployment. The micro service architecutre essentially entails that different aspects/features of the project can be worked on independently and deployed separately. In this manner the application is not a whole and hence in case of an issue the entire website dosent need to brought down. We can continue to work and upgrade independent features and incorporate them onto websites.

## Steps to setup an API

functions>classes>modules>packages>APIs maybe?
